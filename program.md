## Program Overview

**Venue**: The meeting will be hosted in the ([Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/buildings/diamond)) at the University of Sheffield.

## Plenary Speakers

We are delighted to announce three fantastic pleanary speaker!

### Katerina Guschanski
Senior Lecturer in Genomics, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh & Department of Ecology and Genetics, Animal Ecology, Uppsala University

**About Katerina.** The work in my group focuses on questions in speciation genomics, conservation genomics, and metagenomics. We like using samples that others tend to stay away from: feaces, bones, skins, and preserved bacterial biofilms contained in dental calculus. These samples have a story to tell, not only about the individual they come from but also about the time when this individual lived. It is this temporal aspect that we are most excited about. 

**Preliminary talk title:** Old samples - new insights: Museum collections as time machines for questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation

### Stephen Wright
Professor and Canada Research Chair in Population Genomics, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto

**About Stephen.** Research in the lab focuses on plant population and evolutionary genomics, with a particular focus on the causes and consequences of reproductive system evolution, and on understanding the genomic extent and dynamics of plant adaptation. Our goals are to use population and evolutionary genomics to test long-standing evolutionary theory, and to apply evolutionary perspectives to better understand genome structure and function. 

**Preliminary talk title:** Adaptation and maladaption in plant genome

### Ravinder Kanda
Senior Lecturer in Evolutionary Genomics, Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Oxford Brookes University

**About Ravinder.** Research in my group focuses on understanding the various evolutionary processes that have shaped the composition and evolution of genomes; more recently the focus has been on Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEâ€™s) which constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. To date, much of the research in this area has focused on mammalian genomes. With the abundance of genomic data from a variety of species now available, we now have the opportunity to investigate the impact of these virally derived insertions across the tree of life.

**Preliminary talk title:** Stowaways in the Genome

## Workshop

On Monday afternoon, January 6, The NERC Environmental Omics Facilty ([NEOF](https://neof.org.uk/training/)) will provide a workshop titled **Population Genomics**. More information and instructions on how to register will follow soon.
